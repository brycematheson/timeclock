# timeclock
An open-source timeclock management system built in HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and JQuery. It still needs some work, when I have a free second, but all the basic functionality should be there for the most part. Feel free to drop me a comment and let me know if there are any fixes or changes needed.
